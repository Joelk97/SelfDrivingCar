            drive a car on a 3-line road full with other cars, wich he has to Schivare.
            Your task is to help the AI to learn how to drive, by changing the amount of cars and learning rate.
            You can set the amount of cars, depending on the power of your browser and CPU.
            The learning rate is to set between 0 and 1, and dependig on this value, the cars imitate the best car or neither.
            At the beginning is better to set the value near 0.2-0.3. At the end the learning rate should be as near as possible to 0.
            Each time you think the acual car is good, you can save it.
            To reset the simulation click on the trash. Your best car is going to be deleted.
